### **Java Software Engineer Intern**  
**March 2025 – June 2025 | Yum China Holdings Limited**  

#### Key Contributions:  
- Be responsible for developing and maintaining the API scene performance synchronization function of more than 20 APPs and applets such as KFC, Pizzahut, KFC Home Express, etc., use XXL-JOB to schedule distributed tasks on a regular basis, summarize performance scoring data such as interface time consumption, crash rate, error code of various indicators, and display performance change trends in the form of performance daily reports and biweekly reports to support the performance monitoring of the Bisheng technology midrange.
- Based on the XXL-JOB scheduling framework, design an asynchronous task concurrency model, manage multiple subtasks (network exceptions, request frequency, request time) through a custom thread pool, and combine Future to achieve task isolation and data aggregation, improving the efficiency and stability of performance data synchronization.
- Develop an iterative technology platform to release tasks and build a task management module. Help client developers such as KFC APP, Pizzahut APP, KFC Tiktok applet, KFC Alipay applet to build a CI/CD automated pipeline from code submission to construction, testing, production deployment, etc.
- 14 distributed scheduled tasks were launched online. By optimizing the scheduling strategy of scheduled tasks and designing a double check mechanism based on the XXL-JOB scheduling platform, an anomaly aware scheduled task was combined with an automatic retry strategy to achieve self-healing of data synchronization anomalies. In the event of a final failure, a precise alarm was triggered by the Feishu robot.
- Led the full lifecycle development of 26 RESTful API interfaces, including modules such as version data visualization dashboards and buried point requirement detail queries. Implemented interface document automation using Swagger. Built a CI/CD automated pipeline based on Jenkins, successfully ensuring zero failure deployment from development, testing to production environment.
- Perform slow SQL optimization, solve index failure, assist in troubleshooting online issues reported by other departments, and produce 15 technical documents.

**2025年3月 – 2025年6月 | 百胜中国控股有限公司**  

#### 主要贡献:  
- 负责开发维护肯德基、必胜客、KFC宅急送等20余款APP、小程序的API场景性能同步功能，使用XXL-JOB进行分布式任务的定时调度，对各项指标的接口耗时、崩溃率、错误码等性能评分数据进行汇总，并以性能日报和双周报的形式展示性能变化趋势，支撑毕昇技术中台的性能监控。
- 基于XXL-JOB调度框架，设计异步任务并发模型，通过自定义线程池，管理多子任务（网络异常，请求次数，请求耗时），结合Future实现任务隔离与数据聚合，提升性能数据同步的高效性与稳定性。
- 开发迭代技术中台中发布任务，构建任务管理模块。帮助KFC APP，必胜客APP，KFC抖音小程序，KFC支付宝小程序等客户端开发者打造，从代码提交到构建、测试、生产部署等CI/CD自动化流水线。
- 上线14个分布式定时任务，通过优化定时任务调度策略，基于XXL-JOB调度平台设计双重校验机制，通过异常感知型定时任务配合自动重试策略，实现数据同步异常自愈，最终失败时,通过飞书机器人精确告警。
- 主导完成26个RESTful API接口全生命周期开发，包括版本数据可视化看板、埋点需求详情查询等模块，采用Swagger实现接口文档自动化。基于Jenkins搭建CI/CD自动化流水线，成功保障从开发、测试到生产环境的零故障部署。
- 进行慢SQL优化，解决索引失效,辅助排查其他部门反馈的线上问题，产出15篇技术文档。
